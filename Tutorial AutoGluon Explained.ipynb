This is because they require calculating distances between each new data point and all training points, which can be time-consuming.\n","\n","**Sensitivity to Noise:** KNN models are sensitive to noise in the data. Outliers or noisy data points can significantly impact the predictions, leading to less accurate results.\n","\n","**Scalability Issues:** As the dataset size grows, KNN models can become increasingly difficult to scale. The computational complexity increases linearly with the number of training points, making it challenging to handle large datasets efficiently.\n","\n","**Interpretability:** KNN models are generally less interpretable compared to other machine learning algorithms. It can be difficult to understand how the model arrived at a particular prediction, making it harder to explain the model's behavior.\n","\n","\n","In summary, while KNN can be a simple and effective algorithm for certain problems, its drawbacks in terms of computational cost, sensitivity to noise, scalability, and interpretability make it less suitable for larger or more complex datasets. The decision to exclude KNN models from the training process in this specific case is likely based on these considerations and the desire to use more efficient and interpretable algorithms."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"aae2a022","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-14T09:54:35.428715Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-14T09:54:35.426154Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-14T09:54:36.2973Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-14T09:54:36.295533Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.888579,"end_time":"2024-09-14T09:54:36.299964","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-14T09:54:35.411385","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["*** Summary of fit() ***\n","Estimated performance of each model:\n","                     model     score_val              eval_metric  pred_time_val     fit_time  pred_time_val_marginal  fit_time_marginal  stack_level  can_infer  fit_order\n","0      WeightedEnsemble_L3 -72573.661140  root_mean_squared_error      57.337461  3302.390556                0.003945           0.387048            3       True         12\n","1      WeightedEnsemble_L2 -72604.944503  root_mean_squared_error      37.734314  2159.902057                0.003633           0.313787            2       True          8\n","2        LightGBMXT_BAG_L2 -72696.583639  root_mean_squared_error      39.439569  2323.636417                0.486055          66.015706            2       True          9\n","3          CatBoost_BAG_L1 -72815.007054  root_mean_squared_error       0.841123   998.990257                0.841123         998.990257            1       True          4\n","4        LightGBMXT_BAG_L1 -72917.481425  root_mean_squared_error       0.672141    63.986372                0.672141          63.986372            1       True          1\n","5   NeuralNetFastAI_BAG_L1 -72957.033953  root_mean_squared_error       4.936075   254.839794                4.936075         254.839794            1       True          6\n","6          LightGBM_BAG_L2 -73101.683856  root_mean_squared_error      39.344334  2318.702806                0.390820          61.082094            2       True         10\n","7          LightGBM_BAG_L1 -73211.006130  root_mean_squared_error       0.468719    58.300172                0.468719          58.300172            1       True          2\n","8   RandomForestMSE_BAG_L2 -74571.236840  root_mean_squared_error      56.847461  3235.987803               17.893947         978.367091            2       True         11\n","9           XGBoost_BAG_L1 -74728.178853  root_mean_squared_error       1.222832    98.032442                1.222832          98.032442            1       True          7\n","10    ExtraTreesMSE_BAG_L1 -77344.072883  root_mean_squared_error      15.061960   343.568007               15.061960         343.568007            1       True          5\n","11  RandomForestMSE_BAG_L1 -78153.007850  root_mean_squared_error      15.750665   439.903667               15.750665         439.903667            1       True          3\n","Number of models trained: 12\n","Types of models trained:\n","{'WeightedEnsembleModel', 'StackerEnsembleModel_LGB', 'StackerEnsembleModel_RF', 'StackerEnsembleModel_CatBoost', 'StackerEnsembleModel_XGBoost', 'StackerEnsembleModel_NNFastAiTabular', 'StackerEnsembleModel_XT'}\n","Bagging used: True  (with 8 folds)\n","Multi-layer stack-ensembling used: True  (with 3 levels)\n","Feature Metadata (Processed):\n","(raw dtype, special dtypes):\n","('category', [])                    :  7 | ['brand', 'model', 'fuel_type', 'transmission', 'ext_col', ...]\n","('category', ['text_as_category'])  :  1 | ['engine']\n","('int', [])                         :  2 | ['model_year', 'milage']\n","('int', ['binned', 'text_special']) : 11 | ['engine.char_count', 'engine.word_count', 'engine.capital_ratio', 'engine.lower_ratio', 'engine.digit_ratio', ...]\n","('int', ['bool'])                   :  1 | ['clean_title']\n","('int', ['text_ngram'])             : 65 | ['__nlp__.0hp', '__nlp__.0hp 0l', '__nlp__.0hp 0l cylinder', '__nlp__.0hp 0l straight', '__nlp__.0hp 0l v6', ...]\n","Plot summary of models saved to file: AutogluonModels/ag-20240914_082443SummaryOfModels.html\n","*** End of fit() summary ***\n"]}],"source":["results = predictor.fit_summary()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ba7b2012","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.01163,"end_time":"2024-09-14T09:54:36.323877","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-14T09:54:36.312247","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["* **fit_summary():** After training is complete, this method outputs a summary of the models trained, their performance, and additional statistics.
