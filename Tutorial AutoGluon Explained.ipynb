data prediction, image classification, text analysis, and more. It automates the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model selection and hyperparameter tuning, making it accessible for users with minimal coding and machine learning expertise. AutoGluon supports both classification and regression problems and leverages powerful ensemble techniques to deliver high-quality models. It also allows users to specify resource constraints, like time limits and hardware availability (GPUs/CPUs), to optimize model training efficiency."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0708bebc","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006934,"end_time":"2024-09-12T06:38:10.191325","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-12T06:38:10.184391","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# AutoGluon Code with Explanation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"id":"407a798a","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-12T06:38:10.207569Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-12T06:38:10.207154Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-12T16:38:32.948684Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-12T16:38:32.947587Z"},"papermill":{"duration":36022.754283,"end_time":"2024-09-12T16:38:32.952664","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-12T06:38:10.198381","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["No path specified.

To avoid alot of text in notebook we will use 0.\n","* **excluded_model_types=['KNN']:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models are excluded from being considered during training.\n","* **ag_args_fit:** This argument allows you to pass configuration options to the fitting process:\n","* **num_gpus=2:** The model will utilize 2 GPUs for training if available, speeding up the process for certain
