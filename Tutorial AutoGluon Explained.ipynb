AutoGluon Introduction\n","\n","AutoGluon is an open-source AutoML framework developed by Amazon that simplifies the process of building machine learning models for various tasks, including tabular data prediction, image classification, text analysis, and more. It automates the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model selection and hyperparameter tuning, making it accessible for users with minimal coding and machine learning expertise. AutoGluon supports both classification and regression problems and leverages powerful ensemble techniques to deliver high-quality models. It also allows users to specify resource constraints, like time limits and hardware availability (GPUs/CPUs), to optimize model training efficiency."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b22c4299","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.009292,"end_time":"2024-09-13T07:24:37.525852","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-13T07:24:37.51656","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# AutoGluon Code with Explanation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"id":"d6765487","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-13T07:24:37.545332Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-13T07:24:37.544892Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-13T10:24:31.848795Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-13T10:24:31.847401Z"},"papermill":{"duration":10794.328346,"end_time":"2024-09-13T10:24:31.862856","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-13T07:24:37.53451","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["No path specified.

This is because they require calculating distances between each new data point and all training points, which can be time-consuming.\n","\n","**Sensitivity to Noise:** KNN models are sensitive to noise in the data. Outliers or noisy data points can significantly impact the predictions, leading to less accurate results.\n","\n","**Scalability Issues:** As the dataset size grows, KNN models can become increasingly difficult to scale. The computational complexity increases linearly with the number of training points, making it challenging to handle large datasets efficiently.\n","\n","**Interpretability:** KNN models are generally less interpretable compared to other machine learning algorithms. It can be difficult to understand how the model arrived at a particular prediction, making it harder to explain the model's behavior.\n","\n","\n","In summary, while KNN can be a simple and effective algorithm for certain problems, its drawbacks in terms of computational cost, sensitivity to noise, scalability, and interpretability make it less suitable for larger or more complex datasets.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n","  return torch.load(io.BytesIO(b))\n"]}],"source":["test_pred = predictor.predict(test_data)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a14c0f4b","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.010384,"end_time":"2024-09-13T10:26:38.522816","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-13T10:26:38.512432","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Submission"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"id":"70431996","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-13T10:26:38.547561Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-13T10:26:38.546292Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-13T10:26:38.882239Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-13T10:26:38.881006Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.35183,"end_time":"2024-09-13T10:26:38.885415","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-13T10:26:38.533585","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["submission['price'] = test_pred\n","submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"databundleVersionId":9057646,"sourceId":76728,"sourceType":"competition"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30761,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":11013.597416,"end_time":"2024-09-13T10:26:44.127036","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2024-09-13T07:23:10.52962","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
