This is because they require calculating distances between each new data point and all training points, which can be time-consuming.\n","\n","**Sensitivity to Noise:** KNN models are sensitive to noise in the data. Outliers or noisy data points can significantly impact the predictions, leading to less accurate results.\n","\n","**Scalability Issues:** As the dataset size grows, KNN models can become increasingly difficult to scale. The computational complexity increases linearly with the number of training points, making it challenging to handle large datasets efficiently.\n","\n","**Interpretability:** KNN models are generally less interpretable compared to other machine learning algorithms. It can be difficult to understand how the model arrived at a particular prediction, making it harder to explain the model's behavior.\n","\n","\n","In summary, while KNN can be a simple and effective algorithm for certain problems, its drawbacks in terms of computational cost, sensitivity to noise, scalability, and interpretability make it less suitable for larger or more complex datasets. The decision to exclude KNN models from the training process in this specific case is likely based on these considerations and the desire to use more efficient and interpretable algorithms."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"ec879340","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-13T07:02:56.966253Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-13T07:02:56.96506Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-13T07:02:57.661817Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-13T07:02:57.660618Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.709187,"end_time":"2024-09-13T07:02:57.664637","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-13T07:02:56.95545","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["*** Summary of fit() ***\n","Estimated performance of each model:\n","                     model     score_val              eval_metric  pred_time_val     fit_time  pred_time_val_marginal  fit_time_marginal  stack_level  can_infer  fit_order\n","0      WeightedEnsemble_L3 -72618.828372  root_mean_squared_error      47.784418  2649.445301                0.003668           0.341261            3       True         11\n","1      WeightedEnsemble_L2 -72676.014396  root_mean_squared_error      16.377463  1392.428075                0.003772           0.249418            2       True          7\n","2        LightGBMXT_BAG_L2 -72710.539309  root_mean_squared_error      31.390675  1795.709381                0.449636          56.759103            2       True          8\n","3          CatBoost_BAG_L1 -72818.622359  root_mean_squared_error       0.867917   865.923343                0.867917         865.923343            1       True          4\n","4        LightGBMXT_BAG_L1 -72917.481425  root_mean_squared_error       0.647945    60.613308                0.647945          60.613308            1       True          1\n","5          LightGBM_BAG_L2 -73098.157665  root_mean_squared_error      31.298200  1792.057617                0.357161          53.107339            2       True          9\n","6          LightGBM_BAG_L1 -73211.006130  root_mean_squared_error       0.478677    56.243195                0.478677          56.243195            1       True          2\n","7   RandomForestMSE_BAG_L2 -74738.088297  root_mean_squared_error      47.331114  2592.344937               16.390075         853.394659            2       True         10\n","8     ExtraTreesMSE_BAG_L1 -77344.072883  root_mean_squared_error      13.563311   302.058488               13.563311         302.058488            1       True          5\n","9           XGBoost_BAG_L1 -77889.566931  root_mean_squared_error       1.004037    44.713133                1.004037          44.713133            1       True          6\n","10  RandomForestMSE_BAG_L1 -78153.007850  root_mean_squared_error      14.379152   409.398812               14.379152         409.398812            1       True          3\n","Number of models trained: 11\n","Types of models trained:\n","{'StackerEnsembleModel_XT', 'StackerEnsembleModel_RF', 'StackerEnsembleModel_LGB', 'StackerEnsembleModel_XGBoost', 'StackerEnsembleModel_CatBoost', 'WeightedEnsembleModel'}\n","Bagging used: True  (with 8 folds)\n","Multi-layer stack-ensembling used: True  (with 3 levels)\n","Feature Metadata (Processed):\n","(raw dtype, special dtypes):\n","('category', [])                    :  7 | ['brand', 'model', 'fuel_type', 'transmission', 'ext_col', ...]\n","('category', ['text_as_category'])  :  1 | ['engine']\n","('int', [])                         :  2 | ['model_year', 'milage']\n","('int', ['binned', 'text_special']) : 11 | ['engine.char_count', 'engine.word_count', 'engine.capital_ratio', 'engine.lower_ratio', 'engine.digit_ratio', ...]\n","('int', ['bool'])                   :  1 | ['clean_title']\n","('int', ['text_ngram'])             : 65 | ['__nlp__.0hp', '__nlp__.0hp 0l', '__nlp__.0hp 0l cylinder', '__nlp__.0hp 0l straight', '__nlp__.0hp 0l v6', ...]\n","Plot summary of models saved to file: AutogluonModels/ag-20240913_060049SummaryOfModels.html\n","*** End of fit() summary ***\n"]}],"source":["results = predictor.fit_summary()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d0166884","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006867,"end_time":"2024-09-13T07:02:57.678817","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-13T07:02:57.67195","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["* **fit_summary():** After training is complete, this method outputs a summary of the models trained, their performance, and additional statistics.

It shows slightly worse performance than the ensemble but may have taken less time to train (Training_Time)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7d5ae703","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00769,"end_time":"2024-09-13T07:02:57.775963","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-13T07:02:57.768273","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Make Predictions"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"id":"6872626e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-13T07:02:57.79419Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-13T07:02:57.793717Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.215829Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.214439Z"},"papermill":{"duration":60.43394,"end_time":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.218671","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-13T07:02:57.784731","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["test_pred = predictor.predict(test_data)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"26996436","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00725,"end_time":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.233502","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.226252","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Submission"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"id":"81da3c7e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.252133Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.250496Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.471926Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.470576Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.234487,"end_time":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.475525","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-13T07:03:58.241038","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["submission['price'] = test_pred\n","submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"databundleVersionId":9057646,"sourceId":76728,"sourceType":"competition"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30761,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":3872.726921,"end_time":"2024-09-13T07:04:03.609776","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2024-09-13T05:59:30.882855","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
